COOKIE CONSENT


Welcome to the Cookie Consent project! This is a simple web page built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project features a cookie consent banner that informs users about the use of cookies on the website and contains a humorous GIF at the end, announcing that the user has "sold their soul".
It was created during my coursework on the Scrimba platform.



Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
